# React Five

In this lecture we cover React Router and how to implement a routing system into our React applications.

Traditionally, when we wanted to create a website that uses multiple pages, we would need to make a request to a server to send back a specific html file to show in the browser. Everytime we would make a request it would cause our web page to reload and this can sometimes be very slow.

A great example of this is the New York Times webpage that can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/).

In modern day web development using libraries and frameworks such as React, only uses a single html file and allow us to create a single page application and prevents us from having to request new html files to display every time we want to route to another page.

So how do we create a single page application that allows us to have multiple pages?

In React, we can use a library called `React Router Dom` that will handle what is being displayed to the screen based on the URL.

This will allow us to create a multi page application effect, with the lightning fast speed of a single page application.
